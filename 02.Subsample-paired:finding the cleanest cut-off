To find the best data we will first conduct subsample paired sequences. This plugin is optional, it functions to generate a random
subsample of paired-end sequences containing approximately the fraction of input sequences specified by the fraction parameter. The
number of output samples will always be equal to the number of input samples, even if some of those samples contain no sequences after
subsampling.
Benefits of using subsample paired-end

1. Reducing Computational Cost:
Paired-end sequencing can generate massive amounts of data, which can be computationally intensive to analyze.
Subsampling allows researchers to work with a smaller, more manageable subset of reads, significantly reducing processing time and memory requirements.

2. Validating Analysis Pipelines:
Subsampling can be used to test and validate the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis pipelines before running them on the full dataset.
This is particularly useful for complex analyses like de novo assembly or variant calling.

3. Creating Representative Datasets:
In some cases, subsampling can help create a representative subset of reads that accurately reflects the overall characteristics of the original dataset.
This can be useful for exploring data distribution, identifying potential biases, or creating training datasets for machine learning models.

4. Balancing Read Depth:
Subsampling can help balance the read depth across different regions or samples, especially when dealing with uneven coverage.
This can lead to more accurate downstream analyses, such as variant calling or differential gene expression analysis.
